      ITEM 19
      FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATIONS
      
      The FTC's Franchise Rule permits a franchisor to provide information about the actual 
      or potential financial performance of its franchised and/or company-owned outlets if 
      there is a reasonable basis for the information and the information is included in 
      the disclosure document.
      
      We do not make any financial performance representations about a franchisee's future 
      financial performance or the past financial performance of company-owned or franchised 
      outlets. We also do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such 
      representations either orally or in writing.
