FDD Pipeline Project Analysis

  Project: FDD Pipeline
  Type: Document Processing System
  Purpose: Acquire, process, validate, and store Franchise Disclosure Documents

  Stack:
    Language: Python 3.11+
    Package_Manager: UV (Rust-based)
    Orchestration: Prefect 2.14+
    Web_Scraping: Playwright, BeautifulSoup4
    PDF_Processing: MinerU/magic-pdf (GPU-accelerated)
    LLM_Integration: Instructor (Gemini Pro, OpenAI, Ollama)
    Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    Storage: Google Drive
    API: FastAPI
    Testing: pytest, pytest-cov

  Architecture:
    Style: Event-driven Pipeline
    Pattern: Multi-stage Processing Pipeline
    Flow: Scrape → Queue → Process → Validate → Store

  Key_Components:
    - Web_Scrapers: State-specific portal automation (WI, MN)
    - Document_Processor: GPU-accelerated PDF parsing with MinerU
    - LLM_Extractor: Multi-model fallback for structured data extraction
    - Validation_Engine: Three-tier validation (Schema → Business → Quality)
    - Entity_Deduplication: Fuzzy matching with embeddings
    - Storage_Layer: Hybrid cloud (Supabase metadata + GDrive files)

  Design_Patterns:
    - Idempotent_Operations: All operations retryable
    - Strong_Typing: Pydantic models throughout
    - Async_First: Async/await for I/O operations
    - Fallback_Chains: Multi-provider LLM support
    - Structured_Logging: Correlation IDs for tracing

  Quality:
    Test_Structure: Unit + Integration + E2E tests
    Documentation: Comprehensive (5 doc sections)
    Code_Standards: Black, isort, flake8, mypy
    Architecture_Docs: Detailed design documentation

  Notable_Features:
    - GPU_Acceleration: 10-50x faster PDF processing
    - Multi_State_Support: Extensible scraper architecture
    - Document_Versioning: Tracks amendments/supersessions
    - Audit_Trail: Complete processing history
    - No_Local_Storage: Direct cloud upload strategy

  Key Strengths:

  - Modern tooling with UV package manager for fast dependency management
  - Production-ready with comprehensive error handling and monitoring
  - Scalable architecture with distributed task execution
  - Strong data quality through multi-tier validation
  - Performance optimized with GPU acceleration and async operations

  Architecture Highlights:

  - Clean separation between scraping, processing, and storage layers
  - State-specific implementations for handling portal differences
  - Sophisticated deduplication using semantic embeddings
  - Comprehensive Pydantic models for all FDD sections (Items 5,6,7,19,20,21)
  - Well-structured Prefect flows for orchestration

  The project demonstrates professional engineering practices with a focus on reliability, performance, and maintainability in processing government regulatory
  documents at scale.
