The representative class plaintiffs, who were customers of West Virginia Oil & Lube LLC (\"WVOL\"), a VIOCF franchisee, alleged claims for breach of contract, deceptive advertising in violation of West Virginia Code §32A- 1- 2 et seq., common law fraud, violation of West Virginia's Consumer Credit and Protection Act (specifically, West Virginia Code §46A- 6- 102(f)(13)), and sought punitive damages. Plaintiffs' claims revolved solely around an environmental service fee (\"ESF\") charged by WVOL at its West Virginia locations. Ashland Inc., VIOCF and Valvoline International, Inc. (together the \"Ashland Defendants\") were named as defendants under theories of direct liability, joint venture and vicarious liability. Plaintiffs alleged that they were misled because the advertised price of oil change excluded the ESF, which was added to the sales price at the point of sale. Plaintiffs further claimed that the ESF was disclosed in advertisements and at the point of sale in fine print, and in a way that led them to believe the fee was mandatory, when in fact it was not.",

In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist with our procedures. We compared the significant actuarial assumptions (i.e., discount rate and mortality rate) used by management to its historical accounting practices and evaluated the change in the pension benefit obligation from the prior year. For example, the discount rate reflects the rates at which benefits could effectively be settled and is based on current investment yields of high- quality corporate bonds. The Company uses an actuarially- developed full yield curve approach in establishing its discount rate. We evaluated management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments. As part of this assessment, we tested the underlying securities used to develop the yield curve to evaluate whether they were appropriate for use in a yield curve and whether the provided yield curve reasonably followed from those securities. To evaluate the mortality rate, we assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, and whether any market data adjusted for entity- specific adjustments were applied.",

For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired are used to establish the carrying values, which are determined using assumptions from the perspective of a market participant and generally an income approach. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives. Valvoline evaluates finite- lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and any assets not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value.",

The referee(s) shall be empowered to enter equitable as well as legal relief, provide all temporary or provisional remedies, enter equitable and legal orders that will be binding on the parties, and rule on any motion which would be authorized in court litigation, including without limitation motions to dismiss, for summary judgment, or for summary adjudication.
