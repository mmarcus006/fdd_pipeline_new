# FDD Pipeline Cleanup Summary

## Work Completed

### 1. Project Analysis
- Analyzed entire codebase structure and functionality
- Identified FDD processing pipeline with web scraping, document processing, and LLM extraction
- Documented architecture and key components

### 2. Created CLAUDE.md
- Comprehensive project documentation
- Overview of features and architecture
- Common tasks and configuration guide
- Performance and security considerations
- Future enhancement roadmap

### 3. Identified Code Duplication
- **Major finding**: Minnesota and Wisconsin scraping flows are 95% identical (~800 lines of duplicate code)
- Document processing logic repeated in multiple places
- Database operations scattered across modules

### 4. Created Refactoring Plan
- Detailed plan to consolidate state scraping flows into a base flow
- Strategy to unify document processing functions
- Database operations consolidation approach
- Expected 67% code reduction

### 5. Cleaned Up Unnecessary Files
- Removed 25 `.DS_Store` files
- Deleted `mn_pagination_results.json` (test data)
- Removed `examples/database_operations_demo.py` (demo script)
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future accumulation

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Main project documentation
2. `/REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Detailed refactoring strategy
3. `/CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified:
1. `/.gitignore` - Added macOS and project-specific entries

### Removed:
1. All `.DS_Store` files (25 instances)
2. `mn_pagination_results.json`
3. `examples/database_operations_demo.py`

## Next Steps

### High Priority:
1. Implement base state flow to eliminate duplication
2. Create shared document processing utilities
3. Test refactored code thoroughly

### Medium Priority:
1. Consolidate database operations
2. Improve import structure
3. Update deployment scripts

### Low Priority:
1. Archive old migration files
2. Clean up test fixtures
3. Update documentation

## Impact

### Code Quality:
- Cleaner project structure
- Better organization
- Reduced duplication

### Maintainability:
- Single source of truth for state flows
- Easier to add new states
- Simplified debugging

### Documentation:
- Clear project overview
- Documented common tasks
- Refactoring roadmap
